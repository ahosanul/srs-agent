**Stop building the wrong thing.** If you've ever spent weeks building a feature only to discover it didn't solve the actual problem—or worse, solved the wrong problem—this methodology is for you.

Let your AI agent guide you through proven requirements engineering that starts with **real customer problems**, not feature wish lists. Works with GitHub Copilot, Claude, and other AI coding assistants to help you create software requirements that actually solve business problems and maximize the impact of your work.

## ⚡ What You'll Get

This methodology helps engineers:

- ✅ **Discover real problems** - Identify what customers actually need before writing any code
- ✅ **Align your work with business impact** - Every line of code traces back to a problem it solves
- ✅ **Avoid wasted effort** - Stop building "nice-to-have" features disguised as critical requirements
- ✅ **Ship with confidence** - Know exactly why each feature matters and to whom
- ✅ **Reduce rework** - Catch misunderstandings early, before weeks of coding are invested
- ✅ **AI-guided process** - Your coding assistant walks you through each step automatically

**Based on peer-reviewed research** by Gorski & Stadzisz, this approach systematically addresses the #1 cause of software project failures: building what stakeholders *asked for* instead of what they actually *need*.

## 💰 Why Engineers Love This

**Before Problem-Based SRS:**
- Stakeholder: "We need a reporting dashboard with 20 charts."
- You: Build it over 3 weeks.
- Result: They only use 3 charts. The real problem was slow data access, not visualization.

**With Problem-Based SRS:**
- Step 1: Discover the actual problem → "Managers must access sales data within 5 seconds to make decisions."
- Step 2: Design solution → Simple data API + 3 key charts.
- Result: Built in 1 week. Solves the real problem. Stakeholders happy.

**ROI:** Spend 30 minutes upfront with your AI agent to save weeks of building the wrong thing.

## 🎯 See It In Action

Here's what happens when you use this methodology:

**Your input:**
```
I need requirements for an inventory management system. Our warehouse
tracks everything in spreadsheets and loses $50k/month due to errors.
```

**The AI guides you through:**

0. **Business Context (CONTEXT)**
   - Project: "InventoryPro" — Warehouse logistics
   - Principle: "Inventory data must reflect physical reality within 0.1% tolerance" (Mandatory)
   - Success: "Reduce inventory discrepancy from $50k to $5k/month"

1. **Customer Problems (WHY)**
   - CP.01: "Warehouse must track inventory accurately otherwise $50k/month lost to errors"
   - CP.02: "Staff expects real-time inventory visibility otherwise delays in fulfillment"

2. **Software Glance**
   - "Web-based inventory system with barcode scanning and real-time sync"

3. **Customer Needs (WHAT)**
   - CN.01.1: "Warehouse needs system to track inventory with 99.9% accuracy"
   - CN.02.1: "Staff needs system to scan items and update inventory within 2 seconds"

4. **Software Vision**
   - "Cloud inventory platform with mobile scanning app for 50 concurrent users"

5. **Functional Requirements (HOW)**
   - FR.01.1.1: "System shall maintain 99.9% accuracy in inventory counts"
   - FR.02.1.1: "System shall scan barcodes and update inventory database within 2 seconds"

**Result:** Every requirement traces back to the $50k problem. You build only what solves the actual business need. No wasted features.

## 👥 Who Should Use This

**Perfect for:**
- **Software Engineers** building features from vague stakeholder requests
- **Tech Leads** ensuring team builds the right thing
- **Product Engineers** validating ideas before sprint planning
- **Solution Architects** aligning technical design with business problems
- **Anyone using AI coding assistants** who wants better requirements

**Use it when:**
- Starting a new feature or project
- Stakeholders describe solutions instead of problems ("We need a dashboard!")
- Requirements are unclear or conflicting
- You need to justify technical decisions with business value
- Reviewing existing requirements for quality

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Step 1:** Install (one-time setup)

Ask your AI assistant to install into your project's skills directory:

**For GitHub Copilot (recommended):**
```
Install the Problem-Based SRS skills from RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS into .github/skills/
```

**For Claude Code:**
```
Install the Problem-Based SRS skills from RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS into .claude/skills/
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Skills must be installed inside your project's agent-specific directory (e.g., `.github/skills/` for GitHub Copilot), **not** in a `skills/` folder at the repository root. A `skills/` folder at the root will not be recognized by your AI agent.

**Step 2:** Start your first requirements session

```
/problem-based-srs
```

Your AI will guide you through the complete process interactively.

> **First time?** Just tell your AI about your project challenge. Example: *"We need a mobile app for field technicians who can't access customer data offline."* The AI will handle the rest.

## 💡 Commands Reference

Once installed, use these commands to work with different parts of the methodology:

| Command | When to Use | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| `/problem-based-srs` | Starting a new project | Guides you through all steps from scratch |
| `/business-context` | Establishing project context | Captures business context, principles, and constraints (CONTEXT) |
| `/customer-problems` | Analyzing business problems | Identifies and classifies customer problems (WHY) |
| `/software-glance` | Quick project overview | Creates high-level software summary |
| `/customer-needs` | Defining what to build | Translates problems into customer needs (WHAT) |
| `/software-vision` | Planning architecture | Documents software architecture and vision |
| `/functional-requirements` | Writing requirements | Specifies detailed functional requirements (HOW) |
| `/zigzag-validator` | Quality check | Validates that all requirements trace to problems |
| `/complexity-analysis` | Deep analysis (optional) | Axiomatic Design quality analysis for critical systems |

**Common scenarios:**

- 🆕 **New project?** → Use `/problem-based-srs` to start from scratch (begins with `/business-context`)
- 📋 **Need structured context?** → Use `/business-context` to establish business principles and boundaries
- 🔍 **Reviewing existing requirements?** → Use `/functional-requirements` then `/zigzag-validator` to validate
- 💡 **Stakeholders proposing solutions instead of problems?** → Use `/customer-problems` to dig deeper
- ✅ **Need to verify requirements quality?** → Use `/zigzag-validator` for traceability check

## 📊 How It Works

The methodology follows a proven process that ensures you discover problems first, then design solutions:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Stakeholder Input] --> B0[Step 0: Business Context - CONTEXT]
    B0 --> B[Step 1: Customer Problems - WHY]
    B --> C[Step 2: Software Glance]
    C --> D[Step 3: Customer Needs - WHAT]
    D --> E[Step 4: Software Vision]
    E --> F[Step 5: Functional Requirements - HOW]
    F --> G[Ready to Code]

    style B0 fill:#dda0dd
    style B fill:#ff6b6b
    style C fill:#4ecdc4
    style D fill:#45b7d1
    style E fill:#96ceb4
    style F fill:#ffeaa7
```

**The WHY → WHAT → HOW progression ensures:**
- ✅ You understand the business problem before designing solutions
- ✅ Every requirement traces back to a real customer pain point
- ✅ Priorities are clear (must-solve vs nice-to-have)
- ✅ You maximize impact by focusing on what actually matters
- ✅ Stakeholders see their problems reflected in your work

**Each step builds on the previous:**
0. **CONTEXT (Business Context)** → Establish principles and boundaries ("What governs this project?")
1. **WHY (Customer Problems)** → Identify business pain ("What's broken?")
2. **Software Glance** → Sketch solution approach ("What might help?")
3. **WHAT (Customer Needs)** → Define required outcomes ("What must it do?")
4. **Software Vision** → Detail architecture and scope ("How will it work?")
5. **HOW (Requirements)** → Specify exact behavior ("What are the details?")

### Problem Priority Classification

Customer Problems are classified by severity so you know what to build first:

```mermaid
graph TD
    CP[Customer Problem] --> O{Classification}
    O -->|Must, Required| OB[Obligation<br/>High Priority<br/>Legal/Contractual]
    O -->|Expects, Should| EX[Expectation<br/>Medium Priority<br/>Business Goal]
    O -->|Hopes, Wishes| HO[Hope<br/>Low Priority<br/>Improvement]

    OB --> I1[Severe consequences<br/>if unsolved]
    EX --> I2[Moderate impact<br/>if unsolved]
    HO --> I3[Minimal penalty<br/>if unsolved]

    style OB fill:#ff6b6b
    style EX fill:#ffa502
    style HO fill:#ffeaa7
```

**Why this matters to you:**
- **Obligation (Must)** → Build this first. Compliance, legal, contractual requirements.
- **Expectation (Should)** → Build this next. Core business value and user satisfaction.
- **Hope (Wishes)** → Build this last. Nice-to-have improvements and optimizations.

This ensures you're not treating "nice to have" features the same as "business critical" requirements. **Maximize impact by focusing engineering time on high-severity problems first.**

## 🛠️ Installation Options

### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

Install directly as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Test locally during development
claude --plugin-dir ./Problem-Based-SRS

# Or install from repository
/plugin install https://github.com/RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS
```

After installation, skills are available with the `problem-based-srs:` namespace:
- `/problem-based-srs:customer-problems` - Customer Problems
- `/problem-based-srs:customer-needs` - Customer Needs
- `/problem-based-srs:functional-requirements` - Functional Requirements

### AI-Assisted Installation

The easiest way—just ask your AI assistant. **Always specify the target directory** so it installs in the correct location:

**GitHub Copilot:**
```
Install the Problem-Based SRS skills from RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS into .github/skills/
```

**Claude Code:**
```
Install the Problem-Based SRS skills from RafaelGorski/Problem-Based-SRS into .claude/skills/
```

> ⚠️ **Common mistake:** If you don't specify the target directory, the AI agent may create a `skills/` folder at the repository root — this **will not work**. Always include the correct path in your prompt (see table below).

### Key Concepts

**Traceability = Accountability:** Every functional requirement (FR) traces to a customer need (CN), which traces to a customer problem (CP). You can always answer "Why are we building this?" No more building features nobody uses.

**Impact:** When stakeholders ask for changes, you can quickly check which problems are affected. When prioritizing, you rank by problem severity — not by who shouts loudest.

**AgentSkills Format:** This repository uses the [AgentSkills](https://agentskills.io) open standard and [Claude Code Plugins](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins.md) format, making it compatible with Claude Code, Claude.ai, GitHub Copilot, and other AI agents.
